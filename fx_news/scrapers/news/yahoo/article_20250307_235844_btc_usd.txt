Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong joined Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jennifer Schonberger at the first-ever White House crypto summit to discuss how the Trump administration is trying to support the crypto industry.

"President Trump really breathed life back into this industry over the last few years. We really felt like we were being unlawfully attacked by the prior administration... The president has taken a leadership role here and decided to bring it back to the US, and it's already having positive results," Armstrong says.

He highlights that Coinbase (COIN) is planning to hire a thousand people in response to regulatory clarity. On bitcoin's (BTC-USD) volatility, he states, â€œthe goal is not necessarily to have bitcoin be zero volatility. We want the price to go up over time."

Additionally, Armstrong stresses the critical need for bipartisan support to ensure the long-term success of the crypto industry, highlighting that such collaboration will help create a stable regulatory environment and foster further growth and innovation.
