SUMMARY: The European Union may delay its retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. until mid-April to allow more time for negotiations with the Trump administration, a senior official said Thursday. The bloc last week said it plans tariffs of up to 50% on a range of U.S. products in response to U.S. levies on global steel and aluminum imports. The EU tariffs were initially planned to take effect in two phases.
