XRP and other cryptocurrencies fell early Friday as President Donald Trump’s plan for a digital asset stockpile failed to provide the boost the market had anticipated. The president signed an executive order to establish a digital asset stockpile and previously said XRP Solana and Cardano would be among the coins included. XRP, which is used to facilitate transactions on Ripple Labs’ digital-payments platform, fell to $2.53–more than 2% down over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.
