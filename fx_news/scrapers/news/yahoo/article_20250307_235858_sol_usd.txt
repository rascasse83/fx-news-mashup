The Trump administration will be hosting the first-ever crypto summit at the White House on Friday. Coinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong and Strategy (MSTR) co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor are among the crypto executives and leaders who will be in attendance.

Yahoo Finance senior reporter Jennifer Schonberger breaks down comments from the White House's AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, and the talking points on President Trump's strategic crypto reserve plans ahead of the event.

Earlier this week, Trump announced that the US strategic crypto reserve would be comprised of cryptocurrencies ethereum (ETH-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), XRP (XRP-USD), cardano (ADA-USD), and bitcoin (BTC-USD).
