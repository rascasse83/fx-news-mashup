Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said officials in Ottawa and Washington are in talks about alleviating the fallout from 25% tariffs on certain sectors. "I'm not going to get into it too much, because there are ongoing conversations, but I will say the focus we have right now is on reducing the impacts of the tariffs," Trudeau told reporters Thursday in Ottawa.
