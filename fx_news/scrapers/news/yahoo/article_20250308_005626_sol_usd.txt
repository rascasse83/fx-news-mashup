US President Donald Trump is set to hold a crypto summit at the White House on Friday. Chamber of Progress CEO and founder Adam Kovacevich sits down with Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss what investors will be watching for at the event.

Trump announced via a social media post that the new strategic crypto reserve will be comprised of cryptocurrencies ethereum (ETH-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), XRP (XRP-USD), cardano (ADA-USD), and bitcoin (BTC-USD).

"I think the [Trump] administration has made some positive moves here," Kovacevich says, highlighting the "really positive": Trump's crypto czar David Sacks, the summit, and "most importantly" the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropping some of its lawsuits against the likes of Coinbase Global (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD).

Kovacevich says the summit could focus on potential regulation or the strategic crypto reserve, among other things.

Also catch Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman weigh in on whether the US even needs a strategic crypto reserve.
