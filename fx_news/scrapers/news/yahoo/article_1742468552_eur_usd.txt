European stocks fell and the euro weakened, after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said tit-for-tat tariffs with the U.S. would weaken regional growth and kindle inflation. Lagarde said an increase in U.S. tariffs of 25 percentage points would lower the eurozone’s economic growth rate by 0.3 percentage point in the first year. Should the European Union retaliate by hiking U.S. tariffs, growth would be slow by half a percentage point, and eurozone inflation would rise by the same magnitude.
