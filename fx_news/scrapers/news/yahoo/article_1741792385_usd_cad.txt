SUMMARY: The Bank of Canada cut its main interest rate by a quarter point to help offset weaker consumer spending and business investment stemming from trade-policy uncertainty. "We're now facing a new crisis," said Bank of Canada Gov. Tiff Macklem, according to remarks he is set to deliver at a press conference. Macklem said the central bank faces a tricky balancing act in weighing up the damage from trade tensions versus the potential for an acceleration in inflation.
